**Bachelor Thesis**  
**ITMO University**  
**Spring 2024**

## Overview
This thesis presents the development of an autonomous robotic system designed for efficient navigation in dynamic environments, with a focus on warehouse logistics. The project involved creating a decision-making framework that enables mobile robots to operate with minimal human intervention, utilizing advanced algorithms for object detection, tracking, and behavior management.

## Key Features
- **Autonomous Mobile Robot for Warehouse Logistics**: 
  Developed a robotic system capable of performing navigation tasks in a dynamic environment, such as a warehouse, where the presence of moving objects (e.g., humans, vehicles) must be accounted for.
  
- **Dynamic Object Tracking**: 
  Implemented an object detection and tracking system using the OpenCV library, allowing the robot to perceive and respond to changes in its environment in real time.

- **High-Level Decision-Making with Behavior Trees**: 
  Designed a decision-making architecture based on behavior trees, which improves system autonomy and robustness. This architecture minimizes human intervention by allowing the robot to make informed decisions under various conditions.

- **Simulation-Based Testing**: 
  The developed system was tested extensively in the Gazebo simulator. Various dynamic scenarios were created to evaluate the robot's performance, validate the algorithms, and optimize behavior before deployment, reducing both development time and cost.

## Technology Stack
- **Languages**: Python, C++
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: ROS2, Nav2, BehaviorTree.CPP, OpenCV
- **Simulation**: Gazebo

## Highlights
- Reduced human intervention through a robust behavior tree architecture.
- Achieved real-time object detection and tracking using computer vision techniques.
- Successfully simulated and evaluated robot performance in complex, dynamic environments.
